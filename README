A simple HTML page where I used some JS to fetch random Twitter Quotes from https://type.fit/api/quotes using Promises(async...await)
and added some basic css for styling and animations.
Tweet Button refers to https://twitter.com/intent/tweet.
Next-Quote button has an onClick effect which returns a new quote to be displayed inside the box.
